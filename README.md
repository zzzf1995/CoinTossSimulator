# CoinTossSimulator
This is a graphics-based program to simulate someone tossing a pair of coins some number of times, and display the results. So for example the user may request 10 trials. For each trial two coins are tossed. The program reports in bar graph form how many times the result was two heads, how many times it was two tails, and how many times it was one of each.
